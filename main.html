<h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>
<p>In theoretical computer science, the time complexity is the computational complexity that describes the amount of computer time it takes to run an algorithm. Time complexity is commonly estimated by counting the number of elementary operations performed by the algorithm, supposing that each elementary operation takes a efficient amount of time to perform.</p>
   <p>Space complexity refers to the total amount of memory space used by an algorithm/program, including the space of input values for execution <b>Space Complexity</b> and O(n)</p>
